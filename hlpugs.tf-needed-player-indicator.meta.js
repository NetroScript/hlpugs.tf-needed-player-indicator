// @description  Displays with an icon and a color if a specific class still needs players to add up. I want to add here, that the algorithm of HLPugs.tf is more lenient - meaning with the current algorithm (23.05.2018) of HLPugs not all classes have to be fulfilled (to be more specific seems like 2 are allowed to be missing)- This algorithm assumes worst case, meaning that no matter how the captains pick, it is always possible to start a game with the current draft.
